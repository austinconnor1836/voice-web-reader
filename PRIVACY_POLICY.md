# Privacy Policy for Highlight Voice Reader

**Last updated: January 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how Lexi ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.**

Lexi is designed to be privacy-first. All processing happens locally on your device or via your browser's native APIs.

-   **No Analytics:** We do not track how you use the extension.
-   **No Accounts:** You do not need to create an account to use Lexi.
-   **No External Servers:** We do not send the text you read to any private servers. Text-to-Speech is performed using the `window.speechSynthesis` API, which is provided natively by your web browser and operating system.

## Permissions

Lexi requires the following permissions to function:
-   **activeTab / Scripting:** To analyze the text on the page you are currently viewing and to highlight the sentences as they are read.
-   **Storage:** To save your preferences locally (voice selection, speed).
